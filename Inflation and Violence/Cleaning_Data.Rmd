Food inflation rate:
\[ \text{Inflation Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Current Food Price Index} - \text{Base Food Price Index}}{\text{Base Food Price Index}} \right) \times 100 \]

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

In this R document I will be specifically just cleaning data and correlating data points that are relevant to modeling, looking at the distribution of the data and saving those back to a new CSV file to be visually assessed in Python and modeled in R. 

Below is the loaded CSV files needed to start cleaning for modeling and analysis work. The link to get the food inflation information is <https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/4483> from December 2019 to December 2023 to complete 4 years of data on internation food inflation. 
"Monthly food price estimates by product and market 25 countries, 1353 markets, 2007/01/01-2023/12/01, version 2023/12/11" -The World Bank of Microdata website.
There are two other factors in the analysis work, that is conflict (gun violence and war) and the US stock Market prices from December 2019 to December 2023.

The current HO: "The occurrence of conflict in key food-producing regions, coupled with fluctuations in the US stock market, significantly influences international food inflation rates. Higher instances of conflict and volatility in the US stock market are expected to correlate with increased food inflation on a global scale."
The current Alternative HO : "The impact of conflict and US stock market fluctuations on international food inflation rates may not exhibit a significant correlation."


```{r include=TRUE}
# Food inflation data
food_data <- read.csv("Food_inflation_2019_2023.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
# time to clean this up
clean_food_data <- subset(food_data, select = -X)
clean_food_data <-na.omit(clean_food_data)
clean_food_data <- subset(clean_food_data, select = -Market)
clean_food_data <-subset(clean_food_data, select = -Currency)
#fix the date
clean_food_data$Date <-as.Date(clean_food_data$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

```

Narrowing down the top most conflicted countries in the past 4 years according to Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts> sited.
Mexico, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Syria (Syrian Arab Republic), Ethiopia, Yemen Out of those listed I found 3

Afghanistan data on Food Inflation open and close, the difference between the two. Its important to look at the distribution of the data to do further analysis and cleaning of the data. If the differences between open and close prices themselves follow a normal distribution, it could suggest a certain level of regularity and randomness in price movements.
```{r include=TRUE}
#switched values to evaluate the main foods we figured out above.
data_afghanistan <- conflicted_countries_food_data_main_food[conflicted_countries_food_data_main_food$Country == "Afghanistan", ]

open_values_afghanistan <- data_afghanistan$Open
closed_values_afghanistan <- data_afghanistan$Close
difference_afghanistan <- open_values_afghanistan - closed_values_afghanistan


# Create a sequence for x-axis (assuming you want a sequence of numbers as x-axis)
x <- seq(length(open_values_afghanistan))
x2 <-seq(length(closed_values_afghanistan))
x3 <- seq(length(difference_afghanistan))
# Plotting Open values for Afghanistan
plot(x, open_values_afghanistan, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Open Values", main = "Open Values for Afghanistan")
plot(x2, closed_values_afghanistan, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Closed Values", main = "Closed Values for Afghanistan")
plot(x3, difference_afghanistan, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Closed Values", main = "Closed Values for Afghanistan")

#seems to be normally distributed, this helps narrow down appropriate models to examine Afghanistan specifically.
hist(difference_afghanistan)

# open and close are distributed to the right
hist(open_values_afghanistan)
hist(closed_values_afghanistan)

combined_data <- data.frame(value = c(open_values_afghanistan, closed_values_afghanistan), group = rep(c("open_values_Afghanistan", "closed_values_Afghanistan"), each = length(closed_values_afghanistan)))

ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = value, fill = group)) +

```
In financial markets, a normal distribution of price index differences might support the idea of market efficiency, suggesting that market prices reflect all available information, and arbitrage opportunities might be limited. Furthermore,  the questioning factor still remains that the open and close histograms are right skewed, which indicate otherwise. Its considered a bullish market indication.

```{r include=FALSE}
# check to values of the Food Index Prices and see if they reflect a normal distribution or not
# Food Price Index
index_afghanistan_data <- conflicted_countries_food_price_index[conflicted_countries_food_price_index$Country=="Afghanistan",]
index_afghanistan_open <- index_afghanistan_data$Open
index_afghanistan_close <- index_afghanistan_data$Close
index_afghanistan_difference <- index_afghanistan_open - index_afghanistan_close

x1_index <- seq(length(index_afghanistan_open))
x2_index <- seq(length(index_afghanistan_close))
x3_index <- seq(length(index_afghanistan_difference))

plot(x1_index, index_afghanistan_open, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Open Values", main = "Open Values for Food Index Prices Afghanistan")
plot(x2_index, index_afghanistan_close, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Closed Values", main = "Open Values for Food Index Prices Afghanistan")
plot(x3_index, index_afghanistan_difference, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Difference in Values", main = "Difference in Values for Food Index Prices Afghanistan")
# these are sckewed to the right to the higher values
hist(index_afghanistan_close)
hist(index_afghanistan_open)

# this seems to hold a normal distribution which is probably best to work with-
hist(index_afghanistan_difference)



```
I recalculated the index values to hold true to the individual products that we are using instead of using the "basket f goods" price index listed above in the original data set. I need to have strong comparisons per region to fully understand inflation in conflicted areas.

```{r include=TRUE}
data_afghanistan <- data_afghanistan %>%
  mutate(MonthYear = format(Date, "%Y-%m"))
grouped_data_afghanistan <- data_afghanistan %>%
  group_by(MonthYear, Product, Region, Open, Close) %>%
  summarize(
    CurrentPrice = mean((Open + Close) / 2), 
  )
#print(grouped_data_afghanistan)

# Calculate the base price for each region
base_prices <- grouped_data_afghanistan %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(
    BasePrice = mean(CurrentPrice)  
  )
# Merge the base prices back into the grouped_data_afghanistan
final_data_afghanistan <- merge(grouped_data_afghanistan, base_prices, by = "Region")
#print(final_data_afghanistan)

# recalculate the price index 

new_index_afghanistan <- final_data_afghanistan %>%
  group_by(MonthYear, Product) %>%
  summarize(
    PriceIndex = mean((CurrentPrice / BasePrice) * 100)  # Price Index formula
  )
print(new_index_afghanistan)
ggplot(new_index_afghanistan, aes(x = MonthYear, y = PriceIndex, group = Product, color = Product)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Price Indices Over Time",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Price Index") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
# these three data points are important to the final set of data for Afghanistan
# Base price, current price, and price index
# merge them into one data set
# all the cleaning for Afghanistan is done-
final_data_afghanistan <- merge(final_data_afghanistan, new_index_afghanistan, by = c("MonthYear", "Product"))
str(final_data_afghanistan)
```
Similarly after looking at AFghanistan we want to do the the same thing for the other two countries. This is just to look at how the data is distributed in the market per country out of the three different countries that we are evaluating.Below we will evaluate the Syrian Arab Republic data, leaving Yemen last. I am trying to break this down so you can follow along regardless of your background. The coolest thing I have learned in College about being intelligent or beign able to interpret data...is that its pointless if you can explain it well enough for anyone else to understand.
```{r include=TRUE}
data_Syria <- conflicted_countries_food_data_main_food[conflicted_countries_food_data_main_food$Country == "Syrian Arab Republic", ]
str(data_Syria)
open_values_Syria <- data_Syria$Open
closed_values_Syria <- data_Syria$Close
difference_Syria <- open_values_Syria - closed_values_Syria


x <- seq(length(open_values_Syria))
x2 <-seq(length(closed_values_Syria))
x3 <- seq(length(difference_Syria))
# Plotting Open values for Syria
plot(x, open_values_Syria, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Open Values", main = "Open Values for Syria")
plot(x2, closed_values_Syria, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Closed Values", main = "Closed Values for Syria")
plot(x3, difference_Syria, type = "l", xlab = "Data Points", ylab = "Closed Values", main = "Closed Values for Syria")

#seems to be normally distributed, this helps narrow down appropriate models to examine Syria specifically.
hist(difference_Syria)

combined_data <- data.frame(value = c(open_values_Syria, closed_values_Syria), group = rep(c("open_values_Syria", "closed_values_Syria"), each = length(open_values_Syria)))

ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = value, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.7, bins = 20, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Combined Histogram", x = "Values", y = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c("blue", "yellow"), .2))
```
```{r include=TRUE}
data_Syria <- data_Syria %>%
  mutate(MonthYear = format(Date, "%Y-%m"))
grouped_data_syria <- data_Syria %>%
  group_by(MonthYear, Product, Region, Open, Close) %>%
  summarize(
    CurrentPrice = mean((Open + Close) / 2), 
  )
#print(grouped_data_afghanistan)

# Calculate the base price for each region
base_prices <- grouped_data_syria %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(
    BasePrice = mean(CurrentPrice)  
  )
# Merge the base prices back into the grouped_data_afghanistan
final_data_syria <- merge(grouped_data_syria, base_prices, by = "Region")
print(final_data_syria)

# recalculate the price index 

new_index_syria <- final_data_syria %>%
  group_by(MonthYear, Product) %>%
  summarize(
    PriceIndex = mean((CurrentPrice / BasePrice) * 100)  # Price Index formula
  )
print(new_index_syria)
ggplot(new_index_syria, aes(x = MonthYear, y = PriceIndex, group = Product, color = Product)) +
  geom_line() +

       x = "Month",
       y = "Price Index") +

# these three data points are important to the final set of data for Syria

Below is the conflict data which is from <https://acleddata.com/data-export-tool/>. This requires a access key to get this data, it seems to be the most up to date data on conflicts. That coincides with the Dates from the Food inflation.

```{r include=TRUE}
# Conflict data


```

Below is the the US Stock Market Data which is from <https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/wheat-data/> and Yahoo Stocks for rought rice <https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZR%3DF/history?period1=1575158400&period2=1703030400&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true>. 
With US Stocks.. need the names of each actual stock that dominates these regions to represent the coefficients of wheat which is my target data. It would essentially look like this: wheat = target, samples = [wheat company 1, wheat company 2, wheat company 3, wheat company 4] with all of the open and close data listed in the US stock markets. Then I will find which coefficients or features are significant in the target data of wheat in that country. You take wheat data from that country in the above Food_inflation_2019_2023.csv that is loaded and that is the target, then building out a data set of different companies of wheat in the US stock market to create the other half of the data. I learned how to do this between Advanced Statistics and Machine Learning. Its kind of important when looking at Linear Regression Models.
```{r include=TRUE}
# US Stock Market Data
