Working with several sites to include World Data.org, Wikipidea and few other places that are listed on the RMD links that can be read.
I have a current working hypothesis: "The occurrence of conflict in key food-producing regions, coupled with fluctuations in the US stock market, significantly influences international food inflation rates. Higher instances of conflict and volatility in the US stock market are expected to correlate with increased food inflation on a global scale."
The current Alternative HO : "The impact of conflict and US stock market fluctuations on international food inflation rates may not exhibit a significant correlation.

Below is a list of countries I screenshot from Wikipedia that intel some of the most conflicted countries: <br>

The ideal is to understand the impact of conflict and US Stock Markets have on food inflations internationally on other countries. I have narrowed it down to 5 countries. Below is narrowing down significant points of the food market that impacted a majority of the regions across the three different countries that was available from the 5 top conflicted countries in Wikipedia, that are in the dataset itself. Mexico is going nuts, I was dishearted to not have information on them from this dataset as it is neighbors my country America, which would be more fascinating to see the impacts of close conflicts to the American Stock Market. <br>

Below is a chart to help you understand product distrubution by Country from the top three most influential food staples in these conflicted countries.

In this visual aid you can see that these three major food distrubutions effect all of Afghanastan and only a third of Syria and half of Yemen. Which help us understand the impacts of the country as a whole by these products.
