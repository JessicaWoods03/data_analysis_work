Working with several sites to include World Data.org, Wikipidea and few other places that are listed on the RMD links that can be read.
I have a current working hypothesis: "The occurrence of conflict in key food-producing regions, coupled with fluctuations in the US stock market, significantly influences international food inflation rates. Higher instances of conflict and volatility in the US stock market are expected to correlate with increased food inflation on a global scale."
The current Alternative HO : "The impact of conflict and US stock market fluctuations on international food inflation rates may not exhibit a significant correlation.

Below is a list of countries I screenshot from Wikipedia that intel some of the most conflicted countries: <br>

The ideal is to understand the impact of conflict and US Stock Markets have on food inflations internationally on other countries. I have narrowed it down to 5 countries. Below is narrowing down significant points of the food market that impacted a majority of the regions across the three different countries that was available from the 5 top conflicted countries in Wikipedia, that are in the dataset itself. Mexico is going nuts, I was dishearted to not have information on them from this dataset as it is neighbors my country America, which would be more fascinating to see the impacts of close conflicts to the American Stock Market. <br>

Below is a chart to help you understand product distrubution by Country from the top three most influential food staples in these conflicted countries.<br>

In this visual aid you can see that these three major food distrubutions effect all of Afghanastan and only a third of Syria and half of Yemen. Which help us understand the impacts of the country as a whole by these products. Doing further investigation into the stocks, since bread is obviously democratized data, (meaning it has no real stock market name, to include the other data points) this makes the analysis hard to compare with US stock markets without researching into the leading market names for the regions. I found Groupo Bimbo SAB de CV, Dr Schar AG, Almarai Co SJSC, and Al Rashed Food Co Ltd are some of the leading players operating in the Middle East & Africa bread market. Those particular players do have stock market names that can be combined data to find information on. Rice is definitly a China market, and wheat....I found in Statistica that Turkey is the dominating wheat market for the middle east. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1364321/middle-east-global-share-of-wheat-production-by-country/#:~:text=Turkey%20was%20the%20leading%20contributor,the%20marketing%20year%202022%2F2023.
Still you find democratized data holds out on actual companies that can help narrow down the actual market of open close, after doing more digging, I finally found the names of the MEA companies for these areas.

You can find more information on those market trends from this site-> https://www.theinsightpartners.com/reports/middle-east-and-africa-wheat-flour-market#:~:text=The%20wheat%20flour%20market%20in,the%20MEA%20wheat%20flour%20market.
Actual names are key to pulling US Stock market trends to compare them to the trends in these conflicted countries. <br>
The funniest part about this research is finding that the most volatile stock is 2 year old male sheep in Syria! Yeah sheep are scarce in violent conflicted countries! The open and close values are rediculious. Obviously, lots of guns and lots of violence, sheep get killed in the conflict.<br>
